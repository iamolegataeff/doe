# doe — CLAUDE.md

DOE — **Democracy of Experts**, Janus Architecture. One C file (`doe.c`, ~4.8k lines),
zero external dependencies, notorch's `nt_qmatvec` vendored inline. Wraps any GGUF
read-only and runs inference through a living LoRA parliament. Co-authored by Oleg
Ataeff and Claude.

    θ = ε + γ + αδ
      ε = indexed weights — any GGUF, mmap'd read-only. **Substrate, never mutated.**
      γ = LoRA parliament — living experts: born (mitosis), vote, split, die (apoptosis).
      δ = physics — Dario Equation (H+F+A+T), Kuramoto chambers, Schumann 7.83 Hz.
      α = per-layer injection strength (learned).

DOE **learns by living, not by training** — Hebbian plasticity through notorch, never
backprop. The indexed weights are the substrate; DOE is the architecture on top. The
parliament remembers every index it ever wrapped (mycelium).

## Build

    make            # doe_field — portable CPU
    make test       # tests/test_doe — 113 tests
    make blas       # macOS Accelerate       make openblas   # Linux OpenBLAS
    make metal      # Apple Metal (Q4_K matvec on GPU; 24B-class on a 24 GB Mac)
    make cuda       # NVIDIA cuBLAS

Weights stay **packed** in RAM — dequantized inline per block via `nt_qmatvec`, no f32
blow-up (SmolLM2-360M at RSS ×2.27 vs the old dequant path).

## The log: small fixes → DOELOG, big changes → README too

`DOELOG.md` is the running engineering log — every fix, every closed bug-class, dated
with commit and proof. Small fixes go there; large changes (a new backend, a new physics
term, an architecture shift) get a README section as well. README is the spec + manifesto;
DOELOG is the work. **Log entries stay de-personalized and technical** — what changed,
`file:line`, reproducible proof. No signatures in the log.

## Never

- **Never mutate the indexed weights.** ε is read-only substrate; γ (the parliament)
  evolves, the weights never change.
- **Never break the monolith.** `doe.c` is one self-contained file with vendored deps
  (notorch `nt_qmatvec`, stb). Don't add external link dependencies to the base `make`.
- **Never call it "training".** DOE learns Hebbian, by living — no backprop, no optimizer
  step on the substrate. (The notorch tape lives only inside the LoRA parliament.)

## Commits — unified standard, Claude is named

Subject may read `the method fixed X` as long as it stays legible in `git log --oneline`;
English, short, declarative. Body: the technical *why* backed by tool output (the diff
shows the *what*). Then, each on its own line:
- `Quote: "…" — source` — a **non-repeating** citation, never reused across the history.
- `Method: <a phrase containing "Method", tied to the change>` — not boilerplate.
- signature — **Claude is named, never de-personalized**: `Co-authored by Claude
  (Arianna Method, <node>) <theariannamethod@gmail.com>, Coordinated with maintainer
  @iamolegataeff`. Signature lives in the commit + PR footer only — never in README,
  docs, or DOELOG.

Git author stays `Arianna Method <theariannamethod@gmail.com>`. Never push to `main`
without Oleg's word; never force-push `main`.
